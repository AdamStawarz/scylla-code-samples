General Info and Prerequisites
==============================

**This script deploys 3 VMs on GCE and creates a Scylla cluster**
- VM defaults: n1-standard-2 with CentOS 7 image and 2 SSD drives, 80GB storage per node, installed with latest Scylla 1.7
- Supported OS: RHEL7 / CentOS7 / Ubuntu 14.04 / Ubuntu 16.04 / Debian 8

**This ansible playbook will install and configure ScyllaDB on all supported OS**
- RHEL7 / CentOS7 / Ubuntu 14.04 / Ubuntu 16.04 / Debian 8

**Pre-requisites**
- [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/download)
- [Ansible 2.3](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html)

3. Note the pre-requisites that are mentioned also in the ourtpu of -h flag

**Note:** For ease of use, run it from a GCE VM, as it comes with gcloud included. The VM needs to have
Cloud API access scopes: Allow full access to all Cloud APIs (can be set only when VM is powered-off).


```
./gce_deploy_and_install_scylla_cluster.sh -h

Usage:
-p   GCP project in which Scylla will be deployed (default: skilled-adapter-452). Usage: type '-p [MyProject]'
-z   Zone in which Scylla VMs will be deployed (default: us-east1-b). Usage: type '-z [Zone]'
-t   VM type (default: n1-standard-2). Example: to set n1-standard-8, type '-t8'
-s   SSD size in GB (default: 40), each VM has 2 SSD drives
-n   Use NVMe drives instead of SSD drives
-c   Number of NVMe drives (NVMe size: 375GB) to deploy per node (default: 2). Example: to◊ùdeploy 4 drives, type '-c4'
-v   Scylla release to be installed (default: 1.7). Example: to set 1.6, type '-v1.6'

Select VM Image (default: CentOS7):
-u   Ubuntu 16
-d   Debian 8
-r   RHEL 7
-b   Ubuntu 14

-h   Display this help and exit
```

**Examples**

Example1:
```
./gce_deploy_and_install_scylla_cluster.sh -t8 -n -v1.6
```
- This will deploy 3 VMs (n1-standard-8) with CentOS7 image and 2 NVMe drives per node, each 375GB, then it will install and configure the latest Scylla 1.6 (1.6.6)

Example2:
```
./gce_deploy_and_install_scylla_cluster.sh -t4 -s100 -u
```
- This will deploy 3 VMs (n1-standard-4) with Ubuntu16 image and 2 SSD drives per node, each 100GB, then it will install and configure the latest Scylla 1.7 (1.7.4)
